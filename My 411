Is the website an actual lender or a lead-generator site? Lead generators take your information and send it to a network of possible lenders. Lead generators might not find you the cheapest loans, and you should be cautious of sites that promise they will.
Is the lender’s contact information – street address, phone number, and email address – easy to find on the website or loan application in case there is a problem later? It’s sometimes difficult for borrowers to identify and contact online lenders, especially if the borrower needs to revoke the electronic account access.
Is this lender licensed in my state? You may have more consumer protections if the lender is required to be licensed in your state.
Will the online lender or website protect my Social Security number, checking account number and other personal information? What are the privacy and opt-out policies? Can you restrict the site from selling your personal information?
Will the online lender pull my credit report? Some online payday lenders will pull a credit report or seek other information from credit reporting companies before giving you a loan. They may want to confirm your identity or see if you have declared bankruptcy.
