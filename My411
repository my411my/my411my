What is the total cost of the loan and can I afford it? They generally have large fees or interest rates and drain your cash in a short period of time.
How will I repay the loan or make my payments? Online lenders may not take a check and may ask you to authorize automatic electronic payments from your banking account.
What happens if I canâ€™t repay the loan? Not being able to make your loan payments on time can result in significant fees. Your lender may offer a repayment extension, which may come with additional fees.
