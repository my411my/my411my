Any time you give out your sensitive personal and financial information on the internet there are risks. If you apply for payday loans online, you could be increasing that risk. Many websites advertising payday loans are not actual lenders, but businesses known as “lead generators,” which make money primarily by finding customers for lenders.

Lead generators will collect your information – including your Social Security and checking account numbers – and then send your request to a network of payday lenders. Your application will then be sold to the lender that offers to make you a loan. However, that may not stop other lenders or service providers from calling or emailing you.

It can be hard to tell if the website you clicked on is a lead generator or an actual lender. Lead-generator sites, however, often use certain phrases, including “matching you with lenders” or “connecting you with a network of participating lenders”
